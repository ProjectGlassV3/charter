# Project Glass Code of Conduct

## Introduction
Project Glass, run by Roxxon Corporation d/b/a Roxxon Open Source Ventures, is dedicated to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participant behavior as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## Our Standards
We expect all participants in our project to adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Be Respectful**: Treat everyone with respect. Be considerate of differing viewpoints and experiences. Communicate openly and thoughtfully with others and be considerate of the impact of your words and actions.

2. **Be Inclusive**: We welcome and support people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

3. **Be Constructive**: Criticism should be constructive, well-meaning, and focused on improving the project. Avoid personal attacks, which are counterproductive to the community.

4. **Engage Professionally**: Maintain a professional demeanor in all project-related activities. This includes interactions in project spaces and in public spaces when representing the project or the Roxxon Corporation.

5. **Respect Privacy**: Respect the privacy and confidentiality of others. Do not share private information without explicit permission.

## Behavior Outside the Project
As representatives of Project Glass and Roxxon Corporation, participants are expected to uphold the same standards of respect, inclusivity, and professionalism in all public spaces, including social media, conferences, and other public forums.

## Prohibited Actions
The following behaviors are considered unacceptable within our community:

1. **Harassment**: Harassment of any kind, including but not limited to, offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or deliberate intimidation.

2. **Violence**: Threats of violence or violent behavior.

3. **Disruptive Behavior**: Sustained disruption of project discussions, events, or communications.

4. **Distribution of Internal/Private Projects**: Unauthorized distribution of projects labeled as internal or private is strictly prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, sharing internal code, documentation, or any other proprietary information without explicit permission from Roxxon Corporation.

5. **Not Maintaining Original Authorship**: Failing to properly credit original authorship of contributions is strictly prohibited. Always give credit where it is due.

6. **Misuse of Resources**: Participants may receive access to Roxxon's resources, including API keys and systems access, as part of their involvement in Project Glass. These resources are strictly for project-related use only. Any personal use outside of the project or sharing of these resources with unauthorized individuals will result in permanent removal from the project and may lead to legal action, depending on the severity and the extent of monetary or intellectual property loss incurred.

7. **Unauthorized Use of Internal Code**: Maintainers are prohibited from using any internal or private project code in other projects without the express approval of the project code owner and written consent via email from [licensing@roxxonlegal.com](mailto:licensing@roxxonlegal.com). Internal and private projects are clearly marked on GitHub as internal or private, and are not publicly viewable.

8. **Intentional Sabotage**: Deceptively introducing any code purposely designed to sabotage the project, or designed to purposely introduce security vulnerabilities or in any way case data leakage, including end user data leakage is strictly prohibited and will result in a permanent ban from the project, as well as extensive public disclosure of what happened, including any and all available information about the committer. Depending on the severity of the actions, we may also refer any and all information to law enforcement.

## Penalties
Violations of this Code of Conduct may result in consequences up to and including:

1. **Warning**: A private warning from project maintainers.
2. **Temporary Ban**: Temporary suspension from the project and related activities.
3. **Permanent Ban**: Permanent removal from the project and related activities.
4. **Legal Action**: Unauthorized distribution of internal or private projects or misuse of Roxxon's resources may result in legal action, including claims for damages in excess of $750,000.

Additionally, some violations may result in more punitive actions depending on the severity and impact of the violation.

## Reporting
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [oss-conduct@roxxonlegal.com](mailto:oss-conduct@roxxonlegal.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Enforcement
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
